This repository contains my solutions to the assignments of the course "Introduction to Deep Learning" from Standford University.

I've used the Youtube videos for learning the theoretical stuff and coded the assignments the students of that course had to submit.

The goal was to get in touch with Deep Learning and to apply the topics learned from the video lessons.
